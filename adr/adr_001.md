# Minimal viable architecture

## Status

Approved

## Context

To respond to the request for an Online Snack Shop, we first want to build a minimal system to engage with the client as we refine plans for future development.

## Decision

We need to build at least the following components:

* Web application, built in React
* Snack Shop Backend for Frontend, built in Node/TypeScript
* Snack Shop Backend is written in Java/Kotlin with Spring MVC
* Database

We have selected these technologies because they are a balance between being widely used in the industry, and complementary to the skills of our available Engineers.

## Consequences

We need to build new software systems to address the needs of the Snack Shop, using our selected technology.

As the system evolves, we will need to make further design and architectural choices, as we go beyond the minimum and get new requirements from the client.
