# Choice of component library

## Status
Approved

## Context
We have decided to go with a React frontend. We already know we need certain common components like buttons, date pickers and other elements. 
We want to make use of a common library for convenience and not to re-invent the wheel.

We looked at the following 3 component libraries:
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): community support, great documentation, easy setup, focusing on accessibility
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/): community support, frequent usage
* [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html): great documentation, pre-built storybooks, focusing on accessibility, another team at MakeBelieveLabs is already using it

## Decision
We decided to go for React Aria Components in order to build on the existing knowledge and to prioritize accessibility.

## Consequences
We currently don't have the knowledge in the team and need to invest in team training to build it up.
