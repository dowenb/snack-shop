# Choice of database

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to choose Database technology to allow the initial development of our system.

We require a free license and a technology that is easy to set up and run. We do not yet need to scale very high and we don't yet need high availability.

We have looked at the following options, focusing on the licensing. In this regard, all 4 options appear to be plausible to use.

- <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq>
- <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/licensing-faq/>
- <https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/>
- <https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html>

We have not considered the following options that have less friendly or only paid licensing options:

- Microsoft SQL
- Oracle DB
- MySQL
