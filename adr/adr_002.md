# Choice of database

## Status

Approved

## Context

We need to choose Database technology to allow the initial development of our system.

We require a free license and a technology that is easy to set up and run. We do not yet need to scale very high and we don't yet need high availability.

We have looked at the following options, focusing on the licensing. In this regard, all 4 options appear to be plausible to use.

- <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq>
- <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/licensing-faq/>
- <https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/>
- <https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html>

We have not considered the following options that have less friendly or only paid licensing options:

- Microsoft SQL
- Oracle DB
- MySQL

## Decision

We have selected MongoDB, because it is quick to get started with development, so suits our initial prototyping stage well, it can scale highly in the future and complements the current skillset of our available Engineers.

## Consequences

We need to accept the risk that we might revisit database technology choice in the future if we find that we need to take advantage of the strong relational nature of SQL.
