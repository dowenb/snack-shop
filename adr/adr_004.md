# Choice of repository structure

## Status

Approved

## Context

We need to decide how to structure our repositories. 

Option 1: We have single repositories for each part of the system, e.g. one for the frontend, one for each backend service, etc.. 
The benefit here is that different components are kept separate by design, they are independent and can be re-used for different purposes.
The downside is that we need to multiply fundamental setups like deployments, Dockerfiles, authorization management, and such.

Option 2: We have a mono-repo that includes all system components in the same place.
The benefit here is that all components can still be modular yet are closely related, are quickly accessible, developers don't have to switch context.
The downside is that we cannot as easily re-use the components.

## Decision

We decided to go for a mono-repo as our snack shop use case is a single system, its components are not intended to be re-used, 
we can more easily showcase it all together to the client, and it would ease potentially handing it over to a third party.

## Consequences

We accept the trade-off of reduced reusability.
